# Bigdata-Projects
This repositories has all the bigdata projects that I have worked on
The folder contains the following files:

1) Pagerank_pyspark - This pyspark code uses lambda function to create pagerank using adjacency list (The adjacency list file is AdjacencyList.txt)
2) kmeans_accuracy - This uses kmeans on the datset employed and then checks the accuracy of kmeans on the datset using pyspark, RDDs and lambda functions
3) College predictor - Using Big Data and Data analytics, we predict the college best suited for a candidate based on GRE score college rank, his/her GPA, TOEFL score.
